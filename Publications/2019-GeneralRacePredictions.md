Title: Predictions of 2019 City Council Elections
Date: 11.05.2019 
---

These are predictions for the 2019 Seattle City Council Election. This is based off of analysis of polls, attending candidate forums, endorsements, and fundraising. 

In the August primaries Seattle saw a 42.7% return rate - which is just slightly lower than the 2015 general election at 46.3% ... If the primaries are any indication we should see about 43-44% turnout. That would be relatively good result all things considered. 

As of this writing Seattle has seen about 23% of ballots returned - I imagine this will jump a lot over the final day. SCC-Insight points out that progressive voters tend to vote late. So, unless there is a wide margin of victory in any one race we can expect the final results to jump around a bit over the next two days. Warning: Early results are not a death toll for any one candidate. 

TLDR: 
- D1: Herbold (51/49)
- D2: Morales (65/35)
- D3: Orion (58/42)
- D4: Pedersen (53/47)
- D5: Juarez (51/49)
- D6: Willis (53/47)
- D7: Lewis (50/50)

Major takeaways: 
- CASE money wins in D3, D4, D6, and potentially D7. If that happens expect major support to go behind Gonzales proposal for a cap on private money in WA elections. 
- If Herbold and Juarez lose it will be a huge reckoning for Mosqueda and Gonzales. Tavel and Sattler are the most dangerous people that could occupy a seat on council - having either of those candidates win will be a major setback for Seattle politics. 
- Willis, Orion, and Pedersen will be form a coalition that, paired with Durkan, will be formative for the next four years of Seattle growth. Morales, Mosqueda, and Gonzales form a progressive coalition. What tips the scales ends up being the winner of D7 (please be Lewis) and how Juarez and Herbold decide to vote on a given topic. 
- If Sawant stays in power that would be a truly significant victory. Expect that to be a huge rallying cry for progressive voters that will push her to align with the progressive coalition I note above. Success of truly liberal policy in the city will depend upon it. 
- I am most confident in Morales and Pedersen. Everything else is an educated guess. 

## District 1.
In 2015 this race was so close that it went to a recount, and Lisa Herbold ended up winning (after initially being defeated by 18 votes).
Nearly 24K people voted in that election - with 26,061 participating in the August primary.

Phil Tavel won the Seattle Times and Chamber (CASE) endorsement - but he is running such a poorly managed campaign that even strong district disfavor won't be enough to defeat the incumbent Lisa Herbold. This is a strange race - it will be close, and if anyone more likeable than Phil Tavel were running Herbold would have been defeated.

**Herbold** (https://www.pdc.wa.gov/browse/campaign-explorer/candidate?filer_id=HERBL%20%20108&election_year=2019)
Total amount raised: $198
Independent
- For: $60K
- Against: $30K 

Analysis: In Primary - Herbold won 50.61 percent of vote, and Tavel won 32.25% - but Brendan Kolding finished third with 16.73%. If we simply add Kolding's vote total to Tavel's (opposition to Herbold) we get a 49/51 split. I think the general election looks similarly. The only chance Tavel has is to turn out more opposition voters and I simply don't think he has inspired people to vote for him or vote against Herbold. 

**Prediction:** 
- Herbold 51%
- Tavel 49% 

Total turnout is close to 27K 

## District 2. 
Tammy Morales gave Bruce Harrell (council president) a very strong opposition in 2015 - losing by only 400 votes. Many felt she should have won that election. When Harrell announced he wouldn't seek re-election the wisdom was that Morales would be his successor, and from the 2019 August primaries there is little to suggest she won't be. Morales has experience, is well organized, and has put in the effort to build a strong coalition in D2.

Her opponent Mark Solomon is very much a centrist - but he is also soft spoken and contemplative, and this often comes off as being uncomfortable in public speaking. He is not nearly charismatic enough to rally voters in D2, and there simply isn't a strong coalition of business voters in that district (yet) to see the strong financial support from CASE make much of a difference. Like D1 - CASE threw money at an unlikeable candidate and it won't make nearly the difference it could have. 

She won ~ 50% of the vote in the primary, and Solomon won only 23%  - Looking at the vote share there is simply no way he could make up this margin. The primary candidates who Morales defeated were in her shadow rather than his. 

An interesting note here though - Morales is the wealthiest candidate in the race. Her husband is a multi-millionaire and they live in what can only be called a mansion in D2. Challengers in the future might attack her on these lines - and an interesting analysis might be that she had dedicated herself full time to this campaing from the time of filing.

# District 3. 
Whooo boy. This is one of the most contested and, to be blunt, ugly races of this election cycle. Orion is the only candidate in the election to have been accused and settled a case about campaign finance violations. 

Sawant has been attacked by nearly every PAC - her face used to rally support of people she isn't even running against. She has been painted as vindictive, self-serving, and radical in ways that are detrimental to the functioning of city council. She may be all of those things, but she is also the council's strongest opposition to the Mayor and big corporate cash. Give Sawant a lot of credit for taking her opponents, not just Orion, head on. This even garnered endorsements from fellow council members like Gonzales who was reluctant to support her in the primary.
  
Let's do the math from the primary first. Sawant won 36% of the vote to Orion's 21.5% ... But the primary challengers who were defeated split a lot of the opposition vote. The total number of votes garnered by Nguyen, Bowers, DeWolf, and Murakami = 13,455 - that alone is enough to defeat Sawant. The question is whether or not opposition to Sawant is strong enough that those voters are willing to support Orion.  

This is another race where the opposition candidate is simply not very likeable. Egan Orion is deceptive - he has waffled on key issues (campaign finance, safe injection, head tax) and has done nothing to ease voters fears that he is a lackey to big business. More than any other district D3 is where you would expect a big business messaging campaign to track poorly. But it hasn't. The business vote in D3 is slowly proving itself to be important in local races, and the changing demographics of D3 (e.g. tech money) are likely showing their face for the first time. The key to victory here is Orion turning out enough opposition voters to elect "anyone but Sawant" 

Sawant has gone full tilt in opposition to Amazon and CASE money. I think this works strongly in her favor. She was also saavy enough to recognize that D3 voters are feeling a pinch from rising rents and built a strong secondary messaging campaign around rent control. She may have gotten a slight bump from Sanders (his campaign even tweeted about this race) ... But Sawant has done much to damage her own image in the lead up to this race. She too has been deceptive in handling finances and she is often out of control in public forums - jumping straight into stern lectures about "Bezos" that land awkwardly. 

Had either candidate been more politically savvy - Orion during the election and Sawant before it began - this would be an easier race to call. But, it isn't and for all of the wrong reasons. Regardless of who wins this race I will bet good money neither is successful in reelection. In some ways, CASE wins even if they lose. They get to continue demonizing Sawant and the narrative of their buying an election goes away. If they win, they get Orion for four years and likely have the political strength to push for some changes they need on council. This is also a win for Durkan, who they see as a viable Mayor in a progressive city like Seattle. But, there will be a major backlash to CASE tactics. This will likely further fuel Gonzales's push for capping private financing. There has been much criticism of Gonzales initial plan to eliminate private money from WA elections - but that misses her bigger point. She's stoking a conversation without specifics. That is good politics even if the pundits want to know how it will be implemented in practice (and evens scoff at her initial missteps in characterizing "private"). She doesn't have to figure out the details just yet. She only needs a narrative about PAC money being a problem before it proves itself to be. Like CASE, Gonzales actually wins even if the candidate she endorsed is defeated. The only loser here, sadly, is going to be the people of D3.

#District 4
Unlike D3 - this race has one of the savviest politicians in the race. And it is not Shawn Scott. Alex Pedersen has quietly led a very successful campaign - doing it with all of the privilege that comes with being a middle aged white man who can afford to dedicate himself full time to winning a seat on the city council. Despite far left criticism for his absence at public forums - Pedersen has actually knocked on every single registered voters door in D4. He has been "smart" not to put himself in public venues where the optics of Pedersen vs Scott are so stark for voters to see. 

Scott had some early missteps but has gotten stronger as the race has gone on. He has the great disadvantage of running in D4 - a district that is old, white, and more moderate than the rest of the city. But, Scott is one of the most popular politicians in the entire race. He received more out of district democracy vouchers than any other candidate. The returning UW population was said to boost some of Scott's numbers, but he will have to capture a huge amount of the non-Pedersen votes from the primary to make this competitive. 

Let's do some back of the envelope math to see how this works out: Tuttle did not throw her support behind Pedersen, but her backers will likely favor Pederson over Scott. Similarly, Myers did not unequivocally support Scott and neither did Mosqueda or Gonzales. Let's assume based on values that Scott captures Myers and everyone else in the primary (save Stuber) - that results in a Pedersen victory. I think this could go Scott's way if he is really successful in recruiting UW students, but I just don't see that happening. If the total turnout jumps above 27K that is a good indication that Scott has a chance.

Of note, CASE did not throw big money behind Pedersen and did not spend against Scott. I tend to follow the money with these predictions. 

**Pederson** (https://www.pdc.wa.gov/browse/campaign-explorer/candidate?filer_id=PEDER%20%20115&election_year=2019)
Total amount raised: $219K

Total amount raised: $214K      
Independent:        
- For: $1.7K
- Against: $4K 

Prediction: 
- Pederson 53% (13.5k votes)
- Scott 47% (12.5 votes)

Total turnout is close to 26K 

# District 5
This race is weird. D5 looked to be locked up for Juarez in the primary. She had establishment backing and is much more progressive candidate than her challenger Ann Davison-Sattler. In fact, its hard to see ANS appealing to anyone other than disenfranchised voters in D5 - but that sentiment seems to be gaining momentum. The Times supported ANS, and Juarez told the Times in a meeting “This is probably my last campaign. I’m kind of tired of it. I want to get back in the private sector.” That is not the kind of assurance that voters want. If Juarez loses I think it is this sentiment that does her in. 

To be frank though, ANS would be one of the few candidates (besides Tavel) that would be truly destructive to the council. She has centrist if not right leaning policies on a number of issues and will actively work against Mosqueda and Gonzales. 

The back of the envelope math also comes out making this a tighter race than I would have thought. Let's assume that all votes against Juarez in the primary were in favor of change in leadership. If these are going to be captured by ANS things look bad for Juarez. That would result in ANS winning by a 3k voter difference. This is the only race where I simply cannot see the primary results being a good indicator of the general election. Why? Again, I follow the money. ANS raised only $60K in this race. That is the lowest of any candidate in the general election (by a wide margin). CASE also chose to support Juarez, and I think that says a lot. 

**Sattler** (https://www.pdc.wa.gov/browse/campaign-explorer/candidate?filer_id=SATTA%20%20115&election_year=2019)

Independent:        
- For: $60K
- Against: $0 

Prediction: 
- Juarez 51% (11.5K votes)
- Sattler 49% (10.5K votes)

Total turnout is 22K 


# District 6
Pour one out for Dan Strauss. He and Shaun Scott are the only two renters in this election. That says a lot about who they are, their station in life, and the hard fought battles they have to wage against well organized, better funded candidates. 

Dan has no elected experience vs Heidi who has a tarnished reputation thanks to strippergate. But the fickle voters of D6 may quickly forget that blunder that cost her a reelection campaign. 

This is one race where its not clear where voters from primary will gravitate in the wake of what was an otherwise close race for second. Let's assume the following happens - Fathi, Lisbon, and Garcia voters go to Willis and the rest go to Strauss. That gives Willis ~16 votes and Strauss ~13.5. D6 and D7 have gotten far less attention from the media about the impact of CASE money, but this is where I believe it will pay off the most. 

**Willis** (https://www.pdc.wa.gov/browse/campaign-explorer/candidate?filer_id=WILLH%20%20115&election_year=2019)

Prediction: 
- Willis 53% 
- Strauss 47%

Total turnout is ~32k 


# District 7 
For a district with a majority of the city's business district this race has not received nearly the attention from media that it should. The candidates could not be more different. Pugel seems to shirk from public debate and Lewis thrives in debate. Pugel is a retired cop and the Lewis a fresh graduate of Berkeley's renowned Public Administration masters program. Voters should have a clear choice - but who they gravitate towards is a bit of a toss up. The primary candidates that were pro-business should be captured by Pugel, but Lewis has been very impressive in public forums. Does this matter? Unfortunately, it probably doesn't. 

Let's do the primary vote capture first. If Pugel captures the pro-business primary candidates he by about a 2k vote margin. Lewis will have to rely upon some voters staying home (e.g. the Lipscomb-Eng and Harper supporters) and a rally of some more progressive candidates to win. 

Lets's look at the money though. Incredibly, Lewis got big PAC support from Hospitality workers union. This is the one PAC that can go toe to toe with CASE in a single district. Will it matter? I think it does, but this is the hardest race to predict. If the vote total is above 24k then Lewis wins. Anything below that I think he loses in very close race. 

**Lewis** (https://www.pdc.wa.gov/browse/campaign-explorer/candidate?filer_id=LEWIA%20%20119&election_year=2019)
