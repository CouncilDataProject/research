### Statement of Intention
_Incubator participants will have an interest in developing and implementing transparent documentation, strategy, or other visioning around questions of sustainability, governance, and/or community health, or a related question. Please use this space to briefly describe a primary challenge that you perceive your organization faces now or in the near future and that you are interested in making a plan to address over the next 6 months. You might also articulate what you hope you/your project might get out of being a part of the Digital Infrastructure Incubator. (400-600 words)_

Council Data Project (CDP) is open-source software that provides a data model, infrastructure specifications, APIs, and a web application to interact with local government event data (meeting minutes, transcripts, videos, voting records, etc.). Our project aims to reduce the barriers of engagement for community members hoping to stay up-to-date on local politics, assist journalists in producing valuable insight into municipal government decision making processes, and afford researchers a novel approach to studying municipal governance. 

Over the last year we have started to attract more attention from open-source communities, civic technologists, and developers that are eager to use CDP in new cities. We are trying to simultaneously develop CDP’s core tools in ways that are manageable for volunteer maintainers, but we also encourage new developers and communities to engage with, extend, and contribute to CDP. While every aspect of CS&S’s incubator program could be useful to CDP at this stage we hope to specifically address our growing need for a more robust governance model.

Some background: Up until now, Jackson Brown has served as the primary project lead for CDP. Generally this has required coordinating 10+ open-source contributors to self-select tasks that help improve the Council Data Project (CDP) application and infrastructure. Most long-term decisions regarding infrastructure, feature planning, and deployment are made as a group, with input from all contributors and only rarely is there a need for an executive decision (we’ve informally described this governance model here: https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/governance/blob/master/governance.md)

However, Jackson is beginning a PhD program and seeking to transition out of the role of executive decision maker while he utilizes the CDP infrastructure for research. As such, we want to develop a more explicit governance strategy for multiple reasons:

1. To recognize and give decision making power to active contributors and maintainers of CDP. 
    - We imagine that this will require a steering council for the project made up of both contributors and users (community members, activists, journalists, and researchers), but we are somewhat naive about what this will require to successfully transition to this model of decision making. Receiving guidance from the Incubator program on how to structure such a steering council, or other governance model, would be invaluable. 

2. To minimize the implicit bias we (and other researchers) bring towards selecting project goals. 
    - We believe it is necessary to create a decision making system that reduces or eliminates the possibility of abusing individual contributors' free time for the betterment of their individual careers or academic research. CDP has many different user groups and we believe it is important to create a governance structure that doesn’t privilege the needs of one group over another. 

3. To develop clear governance strategies that can be a model for other open-source public-interest-technology projects. 
    - Part of the mission of our project is make our tools as “forkable” and reproducible as possible, however, if the project can be easily forked but doesn’t include documentation on methods for accepting community input, achieving consensus for project planning, and generally maintaining a healthy community, then a fork of CDP may not be sustainable. We know this is a dilemma facing other public-interest-technology projects, and we hope to document and share our learnings with others that will soon find themselves in the same position as CDP.  

In short, we’re seeking to participate in the Incubator program to understand how to best navigate and overcome challenges in creating an engaging, sustainable, and shareable, governance strategy. We recognize this is a common problem in open-source infrastructure development, and we hope to both learn from more experienced practitioners and implement sustainable solutions for CDP.

### Evaluation of Capacity
_Participants will receive a one-time stipend of US$5,000 and we estimate that participants will spend 5-15 hours per month for 6 months in synchronous and asynchronous work. Please describe applicants' capacity to engage this block of time; use the stipend; et al. Things to consider include personnel, positions, interest, time commitments. (100-200 words)_

While the Council Data Project acts as an infrastructure to conduct our research activities on, it is also used and built by members of an active volunteer open-source community. We meet as a project every week, and we already dedicate 10 + hours per week working on new CDP features, governance, and maintenance. With the assistance of the Incubator program, we can further dedicate time and resources towards strategically working on sustainability, community health, and most importantly governance. Jackson and Nic are both members of an academic department and research group that highly rewards and encourages work on open-source infrastructure projects. We have both the time and enthusiasm (not to mention institutional support) to fully engage with the CS&S incubator program.

### Other
_Anything else that you'd like to share about your work, your project's history, communities you engage with, or other information. Things to consider include previous efforts to address challenges articulated above, ways in which urgency of that challenge is perceived, exposure to collaborative problem solving around political questions, and so on._

Council Data Project was originally created by Jackson Brown and Dr. Nicholas Weber as a research project during Jackson’s undergraduate study at the University of Washington. After completing his undergraduate degree, we fully transitioned the project to an open-source contributor model. Over the last four years we have grown the project from a small prototype to an application we can scale and maintain all from the help of 10+ core contributors and 40+ hackathon contributors.

The goal of Council Data Project (CDP) is to create easy to use tools that enable community members to find information about their council, assist journalists in their search and analysis of meetings, and support activists as they encourage municipal engagement. 

Along the way, we have interviewed journalists for usability and features, worked closely with activists to understand their needs, and received many requests for more features and more deployments from the community at large.

The Digital Infrastructure Incubator will be an incredible opportunity to learn from experts about large scale open-source project governance and sustainability. And, we are particularly excited about this opportunity because we already follow many of the projects Code for Science & Society sponsors. Specifically, we believe that the mission of Council Data Project closely resembles that of Invest in Open Infrastructure’s ideals - and we are excited about the prospect of working with and learning from that community. We have also been early and enthusiastic adopters of 2i2c’s “Right to Replicate” model in our infrastructure tool development.  

Finally, if chosen to participate in this incubator program we intend to document our work and outcomes specifically so that other public-interest-technology projects can benefit from this experience.
